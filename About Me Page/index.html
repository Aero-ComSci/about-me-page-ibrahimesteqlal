For this future, I am going to first try to do a middle college course during the summer of my Senior year so I could get some more credits. I already have credits from classes I&rsquo;ve taken last year, after doing the classes over summer, I will then go on to graduate high school and either go straight to Las Positas or take a gap year, which is the least likely to happen due to the push I will get from my family to go to school. This is my choice in life because I still don&rsquo;t really know what I want to do in the future, if I were to go straight to a 4-Year University, I would be left with a career that I don&rsquo;t know about and either not like and also be in a ton of debt. I see Las Positas as a way to land on my feet before going to a University and not lose all my money in the meantime. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things that I&rsquo;ve learnt about myself from working jobs and participating in classes over the course of my life is that I enjoy working with people more than I enjoy working alone. There are usually exceptions, like if I want to complete something on my own, but I rarely pick work by myself. My first job was one where I had to work alone and it was very boring and I felt as if I wasn&rsquo;t getting any work done. Comparing my experience from my job, I can say that whenever it comes to working in groups, I have a much more positive experience overall because of teamwork and cooperation pushing me forward. Because of different life experiences, I can say that I am quick in picking what I enjoy and what works best for me. I think that being quick and still understanding what you&rsquo;re doing is one of the most important skills someone can have because of how persistent you have to be in such a short time. This could help me in future as being able to problem solve fast. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some important achievements that I&rsquo;ve made have been becoming much more social than I was a long time ago. During middle school and elementary school, I was much more reserved and would only talk to people that I had known for a long time, but because of COVID, I was able to meet new people that I am still friends with to this day and hang out with them daily. I don&rsquo;t think I would be able to communicate with more people if it weren&#39;t for quarantine, I wouldn&rsquo;t know how to socialize the way I do now. Another accomplishment is how I was able to finally get surgery for a problem that I&rsquo;ve been having for my entire life, being able to fix something that I&rsquo;ve seen as a problem all these years is mindblowing and I don&rsquo;t think I would&rsquo;ve ever been able to do it if it weren&rsquo;t for the support of my family and friends. </span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m going in life at this current moment, I believe that with the skills I have at this current moment would allow me to pursue different lives if I would push for it. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
